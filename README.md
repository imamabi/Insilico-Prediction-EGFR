# Workflow for Insilico Prediction for Drug Resistance in EGFR
## Overview

This project focuses on predicting drug resistance in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) using in-silico methods. The workflow encompasses protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulations, clustering analysis, virtual screening, enrichment analysis, and experimental verification. The ultimate goal is to identify top hit compounds that could potentially overcome drug resistance.
